## JRubyArt.

As RubyProcessing is now deprecated this a home for JRubyArt.

JRubyArt relies on `jruby-9.1.12.0`
and uses the `k9 -r` or `k9 -w` commands.

Decent documentation live here:<p>
[Mac Documentation](http://ruby-processing.github.io/JRubyArt/mac_start/).<p>
[Differences with RubyProcessing](http://ruby-processing.github.io/JRubyArt/jruby_art/update/2015/09/28/comparison.html).<p>

further,

size, smooth and many other setup methods are no longer<p>
supported in the `setup` method. JRubyArt now has a `settings` method.
