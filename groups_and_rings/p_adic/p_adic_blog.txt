The integers modulo p are well known to be a field. Here I look at their relationship to the ring structures generated by taking powers k of p, p^k. The Images presented here, written in RubyProcessing, consider chains of rings connected by projections. Each subgroup is generated by modding out by a maximal ideal. The colors are then chosen as the additive color mixture contained in each coset.
